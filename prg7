Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a rapidly advancing field that aims to
create machines capable of human-like thinking.
AI is used in various industries, from healthcare to finance, improving
efficiency and accuracy. Machine learning,
a subset of AI, enables computers to learn from data and make predictions
without being explicitly programmed.
With deep learning, neural networks can process vast amounts of
information and recognize patterns, leading
to advancements in self-driving cars, natural language processing, and
medical diagnostics.
